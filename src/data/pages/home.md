    subtitle: Why use the Jamstack?

      - title: Better Performance

          According to [Google](https://www.blog.google/products/admanager/increase-speed-of-your-mobile-site-wi/ "Google"), 53% of visitors will leave a website if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load. Even worse, a whopping 79% of online shoppers will stay away from online stores with performance hiccups.

          Jamstack sites are built once and globally distributed - they don't depend on servers to rebuild the page for every visitor.

          '[Enable Security](https://www.enablesecurity.com/ "Enable Security")
          found that over 70% of WordPress sites are vulnerable to hacker attacks. Chances
          are sites secure when first built, but without regular updates and maintenance
          they can quickly fall behind and put businesses at risk.'

          [65% cost savings](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2019/06/12/jamstack_conf-nyc-session-recap-citrix-delivers-better-ux-with-less-overhead-using-jamstack-and-netlify/ "65% cost savings") after moving their business critical documentation sites over to Jamstack technologies. Their documentation sites are visited by 3.5 million users annually and provide technical support for all of their 15 products and related components.

          Because Jamstack sites are built once and served as static files, they can be distributed globally and available almost instantly to your customers around the world.
