            According to [Google](https://www.blog.google/products/admanager/increase-speed-of-your-mobile-site-wi/), 53% of visitors will leave a website if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load. Even worse, a whopping 79% of online shoppers will stay away from online stores with performance hiccups.

            Jamstack sites are built once and globally distributed - they don't depend on servers to rebuild the page for every visitor.
